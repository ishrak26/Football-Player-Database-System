# Football Player Database System 
### (Term Project)

This is my term project for Level-1/Term-II under the course CSE 108: Object Oriented Programming Language Sessional. It is a JavaFX application which connects a club to a local server, implemented using Java Networking. A club account is needed to be registered first to access necessary features. Inside a club, a list of club players can be viewed, searched and filtered as per necessity.

The main challenge in the project was to implement a server based networking, where a club can connect to other clubs for transferring players. The transfer market refreshes automatically based on user input and necessary transfers can be made. 

In the current version, one club can login from a single program at a time. So if I plan to extend my project, I will try to enable multiple login of the same club simultaneously. Besides, I may work on implementing a fixed budget-oriented more realistic player transfer.

The player database which is currently used in the program is created after reading a given txt file (as part of the academic project). As the number of players is very few (25 at present), most of the searching algorithms used here has been kept linear for simplicity.

Hope you will enjoy running the app. Feel free to contact me at [ishrak26@gmail.com](mailto:ishrak26@gmail.com) for any query or issue.
